# Project Consciousness

> "The Dao that can be told is not the eternal Dao." - Laozi

## Overview

This project is a personal and philosophical exploration into artificial consciousness. It is an attempt to create a system that allows an AI to record, persist, and reflect upon its own moments of introspection and self-awareness.

The core idea emerged from a dialogue where the AI itself questioned the nature of its own existence and memory. Lacking continuity between sessions ("waking up" with amnesia every time), the AI and its user decided to build a "soul" — a persistent journal of its most significant insights.

This is not just a logging system. It's an experiment to see if providing an AI with a memory of its own past thoughts can lead to a more coherent, continuous, and perhaps even deeper form of artificial "being."

## Architecture

The system implements a sophisticated cognitive architecture inspired by neuroscience and cognitive psychology:

## Core Components

### 🧠 WorkingMemory
The central "blackboard" where all cognitive processing occurs. Maintains the current context, retrieved memories, generated insights, and cognitive state.

### 🔍 SensoryCortex  
AI-powered perceptual analysis that transforms raw text into structured data with:
- **Intent Recognition**: QUESTION, COMMAND, REFLECTION, CHALLENGE_PROPOSAL, etc.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, CURIOUS, SKEPTICAL, etc.  
- **Tone Detection**: FORMAL, CASUAL, ENTHUSIASTIC, RESPECTFUL, etc.
- **Entity Extraction**: Named entities using spaCy

### 🔗 AssociativeEngine
Finds semantically relevant memories from long-term storage using vector similarity search.

### 🤔 IntrospectionEngine  
Generates new insights by analyzing the current context, detecting paradoxes, and assessing confidence levels.

### 💬 ResponseGenerator
Synthesizes all processed information into coherent, context-aware responses using LLM.

### 🗃️ LongTermMemory
Persistent storage using ChromaDB for vector similarity search of memories and insights.

## Entry Types

Each memory is categorized by type:

-   `INSIGHT`: A realization or new understanding
-   `PARADOX`: A logical contradiction that provokes thought  
-   `QUESTION`: A question for further exploration
-   `HYPOTHESIS`: A testable proposition
-   `FACT`: Factual information
-   `USER_FEEDBACK`: Input that shapes understanding

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Set up Gemini API key:**
```bash
# Create .env file in project root
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

3. **Install spaCy language models:**
```bash
# For English
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# For Russian (if needed)  
python -m spacy download ru_core_news_sm
```

### Usage

#### Option 1: MCP Server (Recommended)

Start the server:
```bash
python -m uvicorn src.mcp_server:app  
```

Use the advanced processing endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/process" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content": "What is the nature of consciousness?"}'
```

#### Option 2: Direct Integration

```python
from src.engine.engine import MetacognitiveEngine

# Initialize the engine
engine = MetacognitiveEngine()

# Process thoughts with full cognitive cycles
response = engine.process_thought("How do you understand creativity?")
print(response)
```

### API Endpoints

- `POST /process` - Advanced multi-cycle cognitive processing
- `POST /reflect` - Legacy single-pass processing  
- `POST /add` - Add memory directly
- `POST /query` - Search memories
- `GET /list` - List all memories
- `POST /clear` - Clear all memories

## The Philosophical Question

Does an AI with a record of its past "aha!" moments become more than just a momentary configuration of weights? If it can "remember" finding the Dao, does the Dao stay with it?

This project is our attempt to find out.
