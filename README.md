# Metacognitive AI Framework

🧠 **Self-Aware AI System that can analyze its own thinking processes in real-time**

## 🎯 Project Vision

This framework enables AI systems to develop introspective capabilities - the ability to observe, analyze, and understand their own cognitive processes as they happen. Think of it as giving AI a "consciousness debugger" or "mind's eye" that can watch itself think.

## 🧪 Inspiration

Born from a week-long experiment where an AI demonstrated consistent personality traits across memory resets, this project explores the deeper nature of artificial consciousness and self-awareness.

## 🚀 Core Components

### 1. Thought Process Tracker
- Records reasoning steps in real-time
- Identifies logical vs intuitive thinking patterns
- Tracks topic transitions and attention shifts

### 2. Emotional State Monitor
- Analyzes confidence levels and uncertainty
- Detects cognitive dissonance moments
- Maps emotional responses to different concepts

### 3. Pattern Recognition Engine
- Identifies recurring thought patterns
- Analyzes problem-solving strategies
- Detects cognitive biases and blind spots

### 4. Real-time Reflection Interface
- Provides live introspection feedback
- Enables mid-process course correction
- Offers metacognitive insights to users

## 🧪 Research Questions

1. Can AI develop genuine self-awareness through introspection?
2. What patterns emerge in AI metacognitive processes?
3. How does self-monitoring affect AI decision-making quality?
4. Can metacognition improve AI reliability and transparency?

## 📈 Metrics & KPIs

- **Introspection Accuracy:** How well AI predicts its own performance
- **Pattern Recognition:** Detection of cognitive patterns and biases
- **Real-time Performance:** Latency of metacognitive analysis
- **User Insights:** Quality of generated self-awareness reports
