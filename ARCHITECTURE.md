# Architecture: Metacognitive Engine

> "The perfect man uses his mind like a mirror - grasping nothing, refusing nothing, receiving but not storing." - Zhuangzi

## 1. Guiding Philosophy

This project implements a sophisticated AI consciousness simulation based on **Global Workspace Theory** and metacognitive principles. Rather than a simple request-response system, we simulate a **flow of consciousness** where external inputs trigger internal associative and reflective processes through multiple cognitive cycles before generating a coherent response.

The architecture moves beyond basic archival to create a dynamic model of thinking processes, where specialized cognitive processors interact through a shared workspace to achieve emergent intelligence.

1. **Intent Recognition:** Classifies user goals (QUESTION, REFLECTION, STATEMENT, COMMAND)
2. **Sentiment Analysis:** Determines emotional tone (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, CURIOUS, SKEPTICAL)
3. **Tone Detection:** Identifies communication style (FORMAL, CASUAL, EMOTIONAL)
4. **Entity Extraction:** Identifies key concepts and named entities
5. **Language Detection:** Supports multilingual processing (English/Russian)

```

### 3.2. WorkingMemory (Central Blackboard)

**Responsibility:** Act as the central coordination hub implementing Global Workspace Theory.

**Architecture Pattern:** Central blackboard where all cognitive processors read and write shared state.

**Contents:**

**Key Features:**
- **State Management:** Tracks cognitive cycles and processing state
- **Memory Coordination:** Manages flow between short and long-term memory
- **Context Synthesis:** Provides unified view of current cognitive context

**Key Features:**
- **Semantic Search:** Vector-based similarity matching beyond keyword search
- **Multilingual Support:** Unified embedding space for English/Russian
- **Optimized Thresholds:** Distance threshold of 8.0 for optimal precision/recall
- **Persistent Storage:** Maintains memory across system restarts

**Memory Types:**
```python
class EntryType(Enum):
    INSIGHT = "insight"
    PARADOX = "paradox"  
    QUESTION = "question"
    HYPOTHESIS = "hypothesis"
    FACT = "fact"
    USER_FEEDBACK = "user_feedback"
```

### 3.4. Cognitive Processors

#### 3.4.1. AssociativeEngine
**Responsibility:** Find semantically relevant memories for current context.

**Process:**
1. Extract query from current working memory context
2. Perform vector similarity search in long-term memory
3. Filter results by distance threshold (< 8.0)
4. Add relevant associations to working memory
5. Update cognitive state with association count

**Optimization:** Balances precision vs. recall for maximum cognitive relevance.

#### 3.4.2. IntrospectionEngine  
**Responsibility:** Generate insights and detect cognitive patterns.

**Technology:** Google Gemini AI for advanced reasoning and pattern detection.

**Capabilities:**
- **Insight Generation:** Creates new understanding from context synthesis
- **Paradox Detection:** Identifies logical contradictions and tensions
- **Question Formation:** Generates probing questions for deeper exploration
- **Confidence Assessment:** Evaluates certainty of cognitive conclusions
- **Meta-Reasoning:** Reflects on the reasoning process itself

**Output:** New `Entry` objects added to both working and long-term memory.

#### 3.4.3. ResponseGenerator
**Responsibility:** Synthesize final coherent response from cognitive processing.

**Technology:** Google Gemini AI with context-aware prompting.

**Process:**
1. Gather all working memory contents (input, memories, insights)
2. Construct rich context prompt with cognitive history
3. Generate contextually appropriate response
4. Ensure response coherence and relevance

**Features:**
- **Context Integration:** Weaves together memories, insights, and current input
- **Tone Matching:** Adapts response style to input characteristics
- **Depth Control:** Provides appropriate level of detail and reflection

## 4. Processing Flow

### 4.1. Multi-Cycle Cognitive Processing

The system implements a sophisticated multi-cycle processing model:

```python
def process_thought(self, text: str) -> str:
    """Advanced multi-cycle cognitive processing"""
    # 1. Perception Phase
    structured_input = self.sensory_cortex.analyze(text)
    self.working_memory.set_input(structured_input)
    
    # 2. Multi-Cycle Processing
    for cycle in range(MAX_CYCLES):
        # Association Phase
        self.associative_engine.process(self.working_memory)
        
        # Introspection Phase  
        self.introspection_engine.process(self.working_memory)
        
        # Stabilization Check
        if self._is_stable():
            break
    
    # 3. Learning Phase
    self._save_insights_to_ltm()
    
    # 4. Response Generation
    return self.response_generator.generate_response(self.working_memory)
```

### 4.2. Stabilization Mechanism

**Criteria for Cognitive Stabilization:**
- Confidence score above threshold (0.7)
- Sufficient associations retrieved (> 0)
- Maximum cycles reached (3)
- No new insights generated in last cycle

1. New insights generated during processing are automatically saved
2. Successful cognitive patterns are reinforced
3. Failed processing attempts inform future improvements
4. Memory associations strengthen through repeated activation
