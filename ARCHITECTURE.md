# Architecture: Metacognitive Engine

> "The perfect man uses his mind like a mirror - grasping nothing, refusing nothing, receiving but not storing." - Zhuangzi

## 1. Guiding Philosophy

This project implements a sophisticated AI consciousness simulation based on **Global Workspace Theory** and metacognitive principles. Rather than a simple request-response system, we simulate a **flow of consciousness** where external inputs trigger internal associative and reflective processes through multiple cognitive cycles before generating a coherent response.

The architecture moves beyond basic archival to create a dynamic model of thinking processes, where specialized cognitive processors interact through a shared workspace to achieve emergent intelligence.

## 4. Processing Flow

### 4.1. Multi-Cycle Cognitive Processing

The system implements a sophisticated multi-cycle processing model:

```python
def process_thought(self, text: str) -> str:
    """Advanced multi-cycle cognitive processing with emotional awareness"""
    # 1. Perception Phase
    structured_input = self.sensory_cortex.analyze(text)
    self.working_memory.set_input(structured_input)
    
    # 2. Multi-Cycle Processing
    for cycle in range(MAX_CYCLES):
        # Association Phase
        self.associative_engine.process(self.working_memory)
        
        # Introspection Phase  
        self.introspection_engine.process(self.working_memory)
        
        # Emotional Processing Phase (NEW)
        if self.emotional_engine:
            self.emotional_engine.process(self.working_memory)
        
        # Stabilization Check
        if self._is_stable():
            break
    
    # 3. Learning Phase
    self._save_insights_to_ltm()
    
    # 4. Response Generation (now emotionally-aware)
    return self.response_generator.generate_response(self.working_memory)
```

### 4.2. Stabilization Mechanism

## 7. Emotional Architecture (NEW)

### 7.1. PAD Emotional Model

The system implements the **Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD)** model for comprehensive emotional processing:

```python
class EmotionalState:
    """Core emotional state using PAD model"""
    valence: float     # Pleasure dimension (-1.0 to +1.0)
    arousal: float     # Arousal dimension (0.0 to 1.0) 
    dominance: float   # Dominance dimension (0.0 to 1.0)
    emotions: Dict[EmotionType, float]  # 18 specific emotions
    timestamp: datetime
```

**Emotional Dimensions:**
- **Valence (Pleasure):** Negative emotions (-1.0) â†” Positive emotions (+1.0)
- **Arousal:** Calm/Relaxed (0.0) â†” Excited/Energetic (1.0)
- **Dominance:** Submissive/Controlled (0.0) â†” Dominant/In-control (1.0)

### 7.2. Emotion Types

The system recognizes **18 distinct emotion types** organized by emotional families:

**Primary Emotions:**
- `JOY`, `SADNESS`, `ANGER`, `FEAR`, `SURPRISE`, `DISGUST`

**Secondary Emotions:**
- `ANTICIPATION`, `TRUST`, `CURIOSITY`, `CONFUSION`

**Complex Emotions:**
- `EXCITEMENT`, `CONTENTMENT`, `FRUSTRATION`, `PRIDE`

**Social Emotions:**
- `GUILT`, `SHAME`, `EMPATHY`, `WORRY`

### 7.3. Emotional Memory System

**EmotionalMemory Class:**
```python
class EmotionalMemory:
    """Persistent emotional experience with decay"""
    trigger_text: str              # What caused the emotion
    emotional_state: EmotionalState # State at time of creation
    intensity: float               # Emotional intensity (0.0-1.0)
    relevance_score: float         # How relevant to current context
    decay_factor: float            # Memory decay rate
    timestamp: datetime            # When emotion occurred
```

**Memory Features:**
- **Temporal Decay:** Emotional memories fade over time
- **Relevance Scoring:** Context-based memory retrieval
- **Intensity Weighting:** Stronger emotions create stronger memories
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifies recurring emotional triggers

### 7.4. Emotional Processing Pipeline

**Phase 1.5: Emotional Analysis** (integrated into cognitive cycle)
1. **Text Analysis:** Extract emotional content from input
2. **Emotion Detection:** Identify specific emotions and intensities
3. **State Update:** Modify current emotional state based on input
4. **Memory Retrieval:** Find relevant past emotional experiences
5. **Context Generation:** Create emotional guidance for response

**AI-Powered Analysis:**
```python
def analyze_emotions_ai(self, text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Use Gemini AI for sophisticated emotion analysis"""
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze the emotional content: "{text}"
    
    Provide:
    1. Primary emotions (with intensity 0.0-1.0)
    2. PAD values (valence: -1.0 to 1.0, arousal: 0.0-1.0, dominance: 0.0-1.0)
    3. Emotional reasoning
    4. Context tags
    """
```

### 7.5. Emotional Response Integration

**ResponseGenerator Enhancement:**
- **Emotional Context Tags:** Guide response tone and content
- **Empathy Simulation:** Acknowledge and validate user emotions
- **Emotional Continuity:** Reference past emotional interactions
- **Adaptive Tone:** Match emotional energy and valence appropriately

**Example Emotional Guidance:**
```python
emotional_guidance = {
    "detected_emotions": ["excitement", "curiosity"],
    "emotional_state": "excited_positive",
    "response_tone": "enthusiastic and engaging",
    "empathy_level": "high",
    "emotional_context": "User is excited about learning",
    "suggested_approach": "Match enthusiasm, provide detailed explanations"
}
```

### 7.6. Emotional State Transitions

**State Management:**
- **Emotional Blending:** Combine multiple emotional states
- **Transition Tracking:** Monitor how emotions change over time
- **Stabilization:** Emotional states naturally decay toward neutral
- **Trigger Patterns:** Learn what inputs cause specific emotional responses

**Quadrant Analysis:**
```python
def get_emotional_quadrant(self) -> str:
    """Determine emotional quadrant from PAD values"""
    if self.valence > 0 and self.arousal > 0.5:
        return "excited"      # High valence + High arousal
    elif self.valence > 0 and self.arousal <= 0.5:
        return "content"      # High valence + Low arousal
    elif self.valence <= 0 and self.arousal > 0.5:
        return "distressed"   # Low valence + High arousal
    else:
        return "depressed"    # Low valence + Low arousal
```
